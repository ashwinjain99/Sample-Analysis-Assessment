# sample_analysis

This is a repository showing analysis of a sample dataset. The purpose of this assessment is to uncover quick, actionable insights from the sample data given and present them in a high-level dashboard, given little direction.

In this assignment we are told the company guarantees a seven-day delivery of test results to clients. I want to see how performance has changed over time, and what factors affect the performance.

Using libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib, I generated visualizations and top-level summaries of the dataset and outlined some insights from my analysis
